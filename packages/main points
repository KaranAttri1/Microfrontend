- [ ] SPA: turn monolithic spa to microfrontend

- [ ] Micro Front end :
Purpose oriented teams
Diffrent teams to handle, different technology

- [ ] Module Fed
Motivation
Multiple separate builds should form a single application. These separate builds should not have dependencies between each other, so they can be developed and deployed individually.
This is often known as Micro-Frontends, but is not limited to that.

Host-> remote

V
remote

Host: what all files to fetch 
Remote: what all files to expose


In host, refactor entry point to load asynchronous
In host, import whatever files u need from remote


- [ ] Index and bootstrap
Well, this really gives web pack the opportunity to realize that before executing that bootstrap JS
file, we have to go and fetch some code from the products project.
That's what the index file is for.
It is just to allow Webpack that opportunity to go and get some additional JavaScript and make sure
that we've got the project code or the products code ready along with the faker code ready as well
before we try to actually do something with it when we actually execute the contents of the bootstrap JS file.


- [ ] Explain app architecture:

Container- : marketing, auth, dashboard(vue.js)
Rules of integration:


- [ ] Dev mode prod mode:
Each project must work with container and individually 

- [ ] Css in js
css scoping : css that affects only one project-> css in js library
<h1>. But in css in js <h1 class=“h1_j1k”>

In prod it is jss1,jss2 -> so not random -> it does so bcz it wants to make css as small as possible-> but this issue doesn’t arise in dev

One way is to write css as auth h1{} I.e with a root element
Issues with using shared bootstrap lib, if in future one team updates version then there may be problems


- [ ] Navigation-browser history and memory history
Browser history for container and memory for rest
2 way communication:
Marketing to container: onNavigate
Container to marketing: onContainerChange

initialPath  (in case of auth )
- [ ] Dashboard: Dashboard App
- [ ] AWS config
